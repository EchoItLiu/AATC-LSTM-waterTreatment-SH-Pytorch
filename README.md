# AATC-LSTM-waterTreatment-SH-Pytorch

  We propose a novel deep-learning model termed “Auto-Adjustable and Time-Consistent Long-Short Term Memory” (Short for AATC-LSTM). AATC-LSTM can utilize an auto-adjustable mechanism for alleviating cumulative errors and time-consistent term that is used for detecting the abrupt change of turbidity values and reducing their impact.
